#About
This repository was created to facilitate the process of project development documentation provided to us by the Law Department which was previously given to the Information Technology Department, PT. Pupuk Sriwidjaja Palembang, related to the Job Training course at Sriwijaya University. The application developed in this project is in the form of a Contract and Licensing Management System, what is meant by a Contract and Licensing Management System is a place to store various kinds of contracts and permits carried out by the Dept. Law. This app can log Activity Logs related to contracts or licenses. In this application there are 3 user levels, namely Admin, Full Access User, and Standard User. The app uses a reminder system, either pop-up on the website or sent directly to email as a reminder to activate the expiration almost regardless of the particular reminder category using SMTP Google Mail. This application was developed using the Laravel 5.8 and Bootstrap 4 frameworks.
